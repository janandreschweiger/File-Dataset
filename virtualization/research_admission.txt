Background:
***********

The Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Laboratory is a software
research and development group within the Dept. of Computer Science and Software
Engineering at the University of Melbourne, Australia.  The University of Melbourne
is Australia's leading research based university, with an international profile
through its reputation for scholarship and teaching. The members of CLOUDS Lab are
actively engaged in the design and development of next generation computing systems
and applications. The lab is working towards realising this vision through its two
flagship projects: Gridbus and Cloudbus.

The Cloudbus project, an initiative that started in 2008 by the CLOUDS lab at the
University of Melbourne, facilitates the realization of the above vision. The project
developed innovative solutions for market-oriented Cloud computing. The current
innovative developments include: (i) Aneka, a platform for developing and managing
Cloud computing applications from market-oriented perspective; (ii) InterCloud, a
framework for internetworking of Cloud service providers, dynamically creating
federated computing environments, and scaling of distributed applications; (iii)
CloudSim, a simulation framework that allows researchers to control every aspect of a
Cloud environment: algorithms, platforms, and infrastructure; and (iv) Workflow
Engine, a management platform that facilitates the creation, deployment and
monitoring of complex applications modeled in a systematic and orderly manner in
Cloud computing environments.

The research, development, and innovation activities of CLOUDS lab are sponsored by
Australian Research Council (ARC), Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and
Research, Sun, IBM, CA, and Microsoft.

The CLOUDS lab actively supports "self motivated, intelligent, and hard working"
students interested in carrying out their research studies leading to PhD or Masters
by Research degree. The University of Melbourne offers scholarships covering tution
fee and living expenses for students with outstanding academic background and
research skills.

Please read Dr. Commer's notes "on the PhD degree and do you have what it takes?" at
http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dec/essay.phd.html before applying for PhD admission
in CLOUDS Lab!

Higher Degree Research Admissions: Call for Applications
********************************************************

We invite applications for admission to PhD or Masters by Research program in topics
related to Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC). We are interested in research
issues related to Architectures, Systems, Resource management, Scheduling, Tools,
Programming Environments that enable:

- Cloud Computing
- Internet Computing 
- Utility Computing
- Cluster Computing 
- Market-Oriented Computing
- High Performance Distributed Computing 
- Grid Computing 
- Web computing 
- Distributed Storage
- Data Intensive Science 
- Peer-to-Peer Computing 
- Service-Oriented Computing
- Innovative eScience and eBusiness Applications

and scale from a single system to the Internet, which is driven by the requirements
of merging eScience and eBusiness applications. In all our efforts, we place great
emphasis on both inventions (theory) and innovations (practice).

Some Pointers to Postgraduate Admission Information:
****************************************************

1. For Masters/PhD admission Info:
--Melbourne School of Engineering Guidelines:
http://www.eng.unimelb.edu.au/study/degrees/phd/overview


Application Form:
http://futurestudents.unimelb.edu.au/admissions/applications/research

[Please fill application and submit all documemts]

Make a request for admission to:
  * PhD Degree if you already hold a Master degree in Computer Science and Engineering or BSc honours 
  * Masters by Research if you already hold a 4-year degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

2. Scholarships: 

International Students: 
  http://cms.services.unimelb.edu.au/scholarships/pgrad

--Melbourne School of Engineering Guidelines on Scholarship:
http://www.eng.unimelb.edu.au/study/graduate/research-applications.html

There is NO separate application form for applying to scholarships - all those apply for 
admission are automatically considered for the follwing tax-free scholarships (subjected to 
funding co-contribution from supervisor):

* International Postgraduate Research Scholarships (IPRS)
  - covers fee and medical expenses
* Melbourne International Research Scholarship (MIRS)
 - covers living expenses
* Melbourne International Fee Remission Scholarship (MIFRS)
 - those who are unable to get IPRS are considered for MIFRS. 

Note that the University of Melbourne offers scholarships to students on competitive
basis, purely based on their academic merit. Currently, students who scored over 80%
of marks or equivalent GPA in in the final two years of their higher education are
considered for scholarship award. In reality, students (especially international
ones) need to have much better academic record (say over 88%) to win scholarship.
Therefore, the CLOUDS Lab encourages students with outstanding academic record to
apply for admission to research studies.

If you fully depend on University of Melbourne Scholarship to support your studies
(both tuition and living expenses), it will be good idea to mention that explicitly
in the application.

Please enclose/submit the following documents with your application:
-----
1. Certified copies of all your marks cards
2. Recommendation letter from your dept head or professors
3. Enclosed copies of all your research papers
4. A detailed Resume: make sure to include brief information about software projects
you have carried out and papers you have published in conferences/journals.
5. Tentative research proposal (not exceeding 4 pages) on a topic of your interest.
 [A sample proposal format can be found at: http://www.buyya.com/ecogrid/PhDRP-97.txt]

   This helps in identifying and evaluating candidate's research potential.
   The proposal is initial idea, but it can be changed later.
   You are encouraged discuss your research proposal in advance with potential 
   supervisors in the group whose research interest matches with yours.

Please discuss your proposal with your prospective supervisor before your submit your
application. If you like to do PhD/MPhil, please contact the Director of CLOUDS Lab.
